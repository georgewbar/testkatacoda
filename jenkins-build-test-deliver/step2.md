# Create Github Organization and Fork repo to it.
Now, we will use one of the two Github accounts that you have. This account will have the `admin` rights of the repo that will be forked later to the organization that we will create now.

1. Sign in to your `<GITHUB_ADMIN_USER>` account.
2. Click on your profile icon in the upper right part of your screen.
