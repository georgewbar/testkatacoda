# Fun facts

Did you know that

* The original name of `Jenkins` was `Hudson`. The project was renamed after Oracle claimed the right to the name `Hudson`. To this day, `Hudson` and `Jenkins` continue as two independent projects, where each project claims that the other project is the fork. [1] [2]

* `Jenkins` is a name that original meant `little John` or `son of John` [3], and `Hudson` originally means `Hugh's son` [4]. It seems that there are some similarities in the mindsets of the names.

* You could see some public Jenkins instances by googling `intitle:"Dashboard [Jenkins]"` or via e.g. this link [https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:%22Dashboard+%5BJenkins%5D%22](https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:%22Dashboard+%5BJenkins%5D%22) [5].
